This website serves as an unofficial information dump about the Sky Gamestar and later Sky Games services that were on Sky Digital's interactive platform from 2001-2006 and 2007-2015 respectively. Some of the games that have been documented have been archived for online play to some extent using [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly).

Please note that some of the aforementioned games may or may not have bugs that may impede on playability.
