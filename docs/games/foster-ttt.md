Based on the hugely popular cartoon series, the fast-paced, action packed fun takes place inside the amazing Victorian Mansion that is Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends. Players control everyone's favourite Imaginary Friend, Bloo, who leaps, bounces and somersaults his way through a variety of unique rooms inside the Mansion. Bloo quickly and easily shoves items of furniture around the Home, allowing him to reach new heights, new rooms, a host of secrets AND destroy an army of haunted fixtures and fittings. Combat is fast and furious as Bloo dodges and deflects flying books spat from evil bookcases, and devious doors that slam to the ground squashing all in their path.
