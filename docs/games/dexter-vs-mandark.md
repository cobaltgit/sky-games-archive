This fast-paced, action-packed adventure takes place in Dexter's Laboratory, which has been taken over by his nefarious sworn enemy Mandark. This provides the ideal setting for a unique combination of destruction, brain-teasing puzzles and exploration.

Players control Dexter, who must draw upon all of his ingenuity to build incredible gadgets to help him regain control of his laboratory. Whether zooming about with his hover-pack or zapping enemy robots with his blaster, Dexter must skillfully negotiate the treacherous traps that Mandark has planned. Winding his way ever closer to a final showdown in the control room, Dexter's wits again come in

<blockquote>
    <p>All is calm. Too calm..?</p>
    <p>But, thinks Dexter, it's been this way for the last three months without even a hint of trouble. Ever since he successfully regained control of his Laboratory from Evil Nemesis Mandark, Dexter has been left in relative peace and quiet to upgrade his Laboratory's Security Systems. So why does he feel so unsettled..? Simply because the work is so, so nearly complete?</p>
    <p>Dexter composes himself and continues to install the final 'Fully Armed Security Tracking Enemy Responder' (F.A.S.T. E. R) in this, the new Upper Wing of his Laboratory. But his progress is interrupted by an almighty explosion below!</p>
    <p>Looking down from his towering precipice, Dexter sees Mandark emerge through a massive hole blown in the side wall of the Laboratory. And Mandark is not alone;</p>
    <p>An Army all too familiar looking Robots flood past Mandark and quickly spread through the Laboratory. Before Dexter can move to activate his 'almost complete' new Security System, the lead Robot contacts Mandark to confirm that the Laboratory has been secured!</p>
    <p>But, if there's one thing that can be relied on, it's Mandark's inability to learn from his mistakes - and his continual underestimation ofâ€¦ DEXTER: BOY GENIUS!</p>
