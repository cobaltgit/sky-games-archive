    <p>Can Robotboy survive the Cyclonix? A wind-blasting device so powerful it can divert even the most determined . And when the Cyuclonix devices blast all in their path onto Razorocks, it's a devastating combination!</p>
    <p>Play as Robotboy and run, jump, climb, fly, dodge, punch and blast your way through the combined forces of General Yakitori and Dr. Kamikazi to save Tommy, Gus and Lola.</p>
    <p>The fate of Tommy, Lola and Gus, and indeed the world, lies in Robotboy's hands.</p>
