<blockquote>
    <p>Something strange has happened to everyone on Eerie Isle!</p>

    <p>All the locals of Eerie Isle are acting very odd. Very odd indeed! And whatever is occurring is affecting every last one of them… from Mrs. Jones the Shopkeeper to Mr. Smith the Miner… and even Old Man Jackson.</p>

    <p>No-one on Eerie Isle can talk - no matter how hard they try. And, to make matters worse, Eerie Isle is overflowing with armies of strange and poisonous monsters.</p>

    <p>But why has this happened? What is causing the odd behaviour? Who is responsible? And how can matters be put right?</p>

    <p>Sounds like a mystery ripe for solving… by Mystery Inc!</p>
