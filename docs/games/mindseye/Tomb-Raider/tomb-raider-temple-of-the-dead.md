# Tomb Raider: The Temple of the Dead

An unreleased Tomb Raider game developed by Minds-Eye. Only two low-resolution screenshots of the game exist - the splash screen and a gameplay mockup, courtesy of [virtuallara.com](https://www.virtuallara.com/tomb-raider-tv-games.html). It is presumed development of this game ceased around the time of Disney's acquisition of the company.
