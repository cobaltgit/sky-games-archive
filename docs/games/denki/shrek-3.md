Fun fact: this originally started out as a zombie shooter-type game but Sky didn't accept it.

<blockquote>
    <p>Confined to his sick bed, King Harold has informed Shrek that unless he can find a suitable heir to the throne of Far Far Away, he will have to become king.</p>

    <p>The last remaining heir to the throne is Fiona's cousin, Artie. Shrek, Puss In Boots and Donkey set off to find him.</p>

    <p>Determined to rule Far Far Away, Prince Charming has gathered a band of fairytale villains to take over the kingdom.</p>

    <p>Can Shrek, with Donkey and Puss In Boots by his side, find Artie and return him to Far Far Away?</p>

    <p>To do so, he'll need to battle his way through Prince Charming's evil friends, led by infamous villains such as Cyclops and the Wicked Witch.</p>

    <p>With only his mud balls as a weapon, Shrek has got his work cut out for him.</p>

    <p>Ready? Aim...fling those mud balls! </p>
