    <p>Oh-oh. There's trouble at the Muppets Theatre. Dr. Bunsen Honeydewâ€™s latest experiment has gone haywire.</p>

    <p>Combining Chemical A with Chemical F was definitely not his best ever idea, and has resulted in the entire downtown Theatre being filled with an invisible gas - which has temporarily turned all the Security Staff barmy!</p>

    <p>The Security Staff have spent the entire day combing the Theatre, locking up the whole Muppet Troupe! Disaster - with no Muppets there can surely be no Show!</p>

    <p>With the Muppets Homecoming Show beginning tonight, time is precious. But so far the fabulous Miss Piggy has evaded capture!</p> 
    
    <p>Her mission - to free as many Muppets as possible so that the Show can go on as planned. With her currently Top Billing she is determined to succeed!</p>

    <p>Take control of Miss Piggy and battle your way past legions of Security Staff across the variety of tages found throughout the enormous downtown Theatre. Locate and rescue Kermit The Frog so that he can, as usual, ensure the Show opens as planned!</p>
