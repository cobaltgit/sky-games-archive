<blockquote>
    <p>It's the holiday season and this year Jerry has dozens of orphan mice to look after. Unfortunately, Tom and his pals are ready to party and 'look after' the mice themselves...</p>
    <p>Take control of Jerry and rescue all the orphan mice to form an army to chase the cats away. Beware! The cats have rearranged the furniture and laid out trails of food to trick Jerry into traps or their clutches!</p>
    <p>Sneak around the house and fight with whatever you can lay your hands on to bash, blow up or crush the cats</p>
