<blockquote>
    <p>The garden is in turmoil! The bitter, twisted and downright mean Ugly Bug has come to spread misery and mayhem. His 'Meanibeasts' are intimidating all the Happy Bugs, who are now too scared to move and likely to get eaten.</p>

    <p>Unless one bug can make a difference!</p>

    <p>Take control of the daring Saviour Bug and patrol the garden, collecting helpless bugs before leading them to safety. A confrontation with the Ugly Bug awaits. But watch out for those Meanibeasts... they bite!</p>
