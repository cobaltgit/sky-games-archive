# Bust-a-Move

A rather unique 2002 release from Denki when their tenure with Sky was in its infancy, based on [*Puzzle Bobble*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_Bobble), a 1994 arcade game by Taito

A precursor to modern bubble shooter games, *Bust-a-Move* involves aiming a pointer with a coloured bubble and shooting it at three or more bubbles of the same colour - the game is over if any bubbles in the level cross the line!
