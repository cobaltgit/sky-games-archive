<blockquote>
    <p>Jerry has returned from holiday to find his home has been overrun by chaotic cats! And they've only got one thing on their mind: MICE!</p>
    <p>Fortunately, Jerry's come back from his hols packing an unlimited supply of bombs - maybe he can use these to clean up the moggy menace....</p>
    <p>By planting bombs near likely-looking fortifications, Jerry can blast his way through the mazes and give the foul felines the comeuppance they deserve!</p>
