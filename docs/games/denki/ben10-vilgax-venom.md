<blockquote>
    <p>In an all new adventure, Ben Tennyson, on vacation in Alaska with his Uncle, must once again face Vilgax who has raised a mercenary army to steal the Omnitrix!</p>

    <p>Vilgax has gathered a robotic army to launch a final assault against Ben. A phalanx of machines: on the march to hunt out our hero and claim the Omnitrix for their intergalactic master.</p>

    <p>Forced to repel wave after wave of vicious attacks, can Ben use all his alien powers to overcome Vilgax and his evil army? With his Omnitrix, Ben has access to five powerful aliens: Heatblast, Cannonbolt, Wildmutt, Upchuck and BenWolf.</p>

    <p>Take control of Ben and turn into Heatblast, Cannonbolt, Wildmutt, Upchuck and BenWolf to battle and defeat Vilgax's forces. Each alien form has a standard and a special attack to repel the villainous hordes with.</p>

    <p>Be careful that not too much damage is inflicted upon the Omnitrix, otherwise it will deactivate and Ben himself will be left evading the enemy attacks whilst it recharges.</p>
