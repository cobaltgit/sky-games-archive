The first, and perhaps most popular game in Denki's portfolio - initially released in July 2001 for the Open.... Games platform and later ported to the Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Colour in October of the same year

Described as "Tetris for the 21st century" by the Sunday Times

Join together Gumblocks of the same colour and make shapes if necessary whilst guiding them with your remote control around the Blockers (white blocks that do not move on the board) to advance through the puzzles!

Three different skill levels to choose from, each containing five puzzles:

- Free Training
- Advanced Play
- Master Puzzles
