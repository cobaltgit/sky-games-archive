<blockquote>
    <p>Hey, where is everybody?</p>
    <p>Oh, Courage... You took a night off and look what happened.<br>Muriel and Eustace disappeared and the Farmhouse was converted into an enormous, creepy Mansion filled to the brim with unwanted guests!</p>
    <p>Yes, that sinister Katz is back. Again.</p>
    <p>Now, if only Courage can find the paranormal-busting props buried around the Farm he can work on getting things back to normal...</p>
