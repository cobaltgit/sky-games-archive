<blockquote>
    <p>After winning an otherworldly limbo contest against the messenger of Death, happy-go-lucky Billy and cynical Mandy become best friends with the Grim Reaper (a supernatural, skeletal creature thousands of years old)!</p>

    <p>One day, Mandy (being her usual cruel self) dares Billy to spend a night in the Old Haunted House down the street. Billy, being a curious chap, agrees - but only if Mandy and Grim come along to enjoy the inevitable adventure.</p>

    <p>But it's not long before they're all totally lost without a clue how to get outâ€¦</p>
