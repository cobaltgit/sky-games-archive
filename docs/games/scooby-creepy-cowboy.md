Denki made not one, but two Scooby Doo sub-franchises! This is the first of two *Scooby Doo Mysteries* games, released in 2006 by Denki.

<blockquote>
    <p>While out driving in the Mystery Machine, The Gang take a wrong turn and end up in the middle of nowhere, only to end up in a spooky old run-down ghost town/Fortunately there's a hotel still open and rooms available. Unfortunately, the Creepy Cowboy and his ghostly gang are in town...</p>
    <p>Sounds like a case for Scooby-Dooby-Doo...</p>
    <p>Take control of Shaggy and Scooby and explore the old town's buildings and mine shafts. Collect clues to help reveal the Creepy Cowboy's true identity. Avoid anything too scary. Better still, push furniture or shove barrels into it. Oh, and pick up any treasure along the way.</p>
