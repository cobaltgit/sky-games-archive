<blockquote>
    <p>One holiday morning, news of a new sinister Adult plan reaches The Kids Next Door at their Treehouse Headquarters… in the form of a Ransom Note!</p>
    <p>Complete with a diagram of a worried looking Numbuh Three, beneath what is referred to as an 'Ageing Device', the Ransom Note menacingly demands that all KND Operatives cease and desist all Anti-Adult Operations! Or else!</p>
    <p>As the Numbuhs gather to discuss their next move, Numbuh One deduces that the Ageing Device can have but one purpose. As all KND Operatives know… when a Kid becomes a Teenager they become decommissioned as a KND Operative. The Adult plan must be to trap each Numbuh and systematically age them all!</p>
    <p>Knowing it’s too risky to send in a lone Numbuh to effect a stealthy rescue mission, Numbuh One elects to send a crack team of Numbuhs Two, Four and Five in - leaving himself free to direct OPERATION T.E.E.N.A.G.E.R. from the Treehouse Control Room. But send them where?</p>
    <p>Using his brand new Gadget, the Solar Powered Ultra Magnifying-Glass Object (S.P.U.M.G.O.), Numbuh Two takes a closer look at the Ransom Note. A very faint and small watermark bearing the words “Gallagher Elementary” comes into sharp focus. Collectively the Numbuh’s groan… SCHOOL! During the holidays!? These Adults really are evil…</p>

Click the menu screen to help the Numbuhs rescue Numbuh Three before the deadline expires - failure is not an option as the Adults would then be free to activate the Ageing device and rob the Kids Next Door of a valuable member!
