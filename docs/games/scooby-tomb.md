<blockquote>
    <p>Scooby-Doo and the gang are back with a monster of an adventure!</p>

    <p>Mystery Inc. are called to investigate strange happenings at Excavation Site Number 13, the location of Pharaoh Ankhanamon the Great’s tomb, a sorcerer of great wealth and power who reputedly had the ability to control the… Gulp!… Un-dead!</p>

    <p>Shortly after the opening of the Tomb, workers began to disappear and the number of Mummy sightings rapidly increased. It’s claimed Pharaoh Ankhanamon cast many spells and curses to protect his Treasure Horde and resting place; spells that would allow him to rise again and curse intruders should any be so foolish as to steal his treasure.</p>

    <p>Excavation overseer Mustapha has had to stop all work in the Tomb; his workers refuse to enter the ancient burial chamber lest they too join the horde of Mummies. Can Scooby and the gang solve the mystery of the mummified minions? Can the curse be countered?</p>

    <p>Sounds like a mystery ripe for solving… by Mystery Inc!</p>
