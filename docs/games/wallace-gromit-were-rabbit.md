<blockquote>
    <p>The gardens of England are in danger.</p>

    <p>From a terror so fierce it will petrify your parsnips, curdle your carrots and chill you to the marrow.  Our only hope... is WALLACE AND GROMIT!</p>

    <p>Charged with protecting local gardens from an epidemic of vegetable munching rabbits, Wallace and Gromit's lauded new enterprise, ANTI-PESTO, has a significant job on its hands!</p>
