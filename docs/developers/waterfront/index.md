# Waterfront Entertainment

<img src="/assets/img/logos/waterfront-logo.png"  style="float: right; padding: 16px">

Waterfront Entertainment was originally conceived as a joint-venture between [Denki](/developers/denki) and [Minds-Eye](/developers/mindseye) in the mid-2000s.

However, before Waterfront started up fully, Disney completed its acquisition of Minds-Eye and thus could no longer be involved - Waterfront instead became a "sister" company to Denki that was used for international work.

Eventually, Denki left interactive TV for console and mobile games, handing its contract, project archives and development equipment to Waterfront, who would continue to make games for Sky and DirecTV.
