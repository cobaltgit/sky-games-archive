Founded in 1995, Minds-Eye were probably best known for their late 90s and early 00s video game releases for consoles such as the PlayStation and PS2, the Nintendo 64 as well as games for PC and Mac OS.

Minds-Eye initially developed ports of arcade classics such as Atari's Pong, Asteroid and Centipede as well as Taito's Space Invaders - later going on to develop iTV games for television shows such as *Big Brother* and *Banzai*

Minds-Eye were acquired by Disney in 2005 and eventually absorbed after developing licenced games for Sky Active based on Disney's properties

None of Minds-Eye's games have been preserved for online playability, however, there is footage of their Tomb Raider games on YouTube:
